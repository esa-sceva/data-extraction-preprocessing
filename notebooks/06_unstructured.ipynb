            "Inertial sensors are useful devices in both science and industry. Higher precision sensors could ﬁnd scientiﬁc applications in the areas of general relativity [1], geodesy and geology. There are also important applications of such devices in the ﬁeld of navigation, surveying and analysis of earth structures. Matter-wave interferometry was envisaged for its potential to be an extremely sensitive probe for inertial forces [2]. In 1991, atom interference techniques have been used in proof-of-principle work to measure rotations [3] and accelerations [4]. In the following years, many theoretical and experimental works have been performed to investigate this new kind of inertial sensors [5]. Some of the recent works have shown very promising results leading to a sensitivity comparable to\n",

            "other kinds of sensors, as well as for rotation [6] as for acceleration [7] and possibility of realizing a full inertial base within the same device [8]. The most developed atom- interferometer inertial sensors are today atomic state interferometers [9] which use two- photon velocity selective Raman transitions [10, 11] to manipulate atoms while keeping them in long-lived ground states.\n",
            "\n",
            "Atom interferometry is nowadays one of the most promising candidates for ultra- precise and ultra-accurate measurement of gravito-inertial forces on ground or for space [12]. From performances on ground, one can expect unprecedented sensitivity in space, lead- ing to many mission proposals since 2000 [13]. This technology is now mature enough that several groups are developing instruments for practical experiments: in the ﬁeld navigation [14], or fundamental physics (gradiometer for the measurement of G [15], gravimeter for the watt balance experiment [16], interferometer for the measurement of ﬁne structure constant thanks to h/m [17]). Moreover, the realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a dilute gas of trapped atoms in a single quantum state [18, 19, 20] has produced the matter-wave analog of a laser in optics [21, 22, 23, 24] and open new possibilities. Alike the revolution brought by lasers in optical interferometry [1, 25, 26], it is expected that the use of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms will bring the science of atom optics, and in particular atom interferometry, to an unprecedented level of accu- racy [27, 28]. In addition, BEC-based coherent atom interferometry would reach its full potential in space-based applications where micro-gravity will allow the atomic interfer- ometers to reach their best performance. Applications of accelerometer in space concern fundamental physics, like testing the equivalence principle by comparing the free fall of two diﬀerent atomic species [29], and more generally testing all aspects of gravity as in [30], which aims at testing the laws of gravity at large scale, as well for fundamental physics as for exploration of the solar system.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the following part, we investigate the sources of noise and systematic eﬀects for such atom interferometers, thanks to the results obtained with the gravimeter under development in our laboratory. This setup is based on same concepts than previous works [7]: atomic source realized with a magneto-optical traps and manipulation of the atomic wavepackets with Raman transitions. In our experiment, we have studied in details the inﬂuence of any perturbations on the sensitivity of the sensor. Reducing there impacts on the noise of the instrument, we ﬁnally reach an excellent sensitivity of 10−8 m.s−2.Hz−1/2, despite a rather short interrogation time (100 ms only). We 1.4 think this experiment is a good benchmarck to oversee the performances of best space accelerometers based on same technologies. Performances in space environment will be derived, taking into account the speciﬁcations of the environment and the much longer interrogation time.\n",

Both lasers used for cooling and repumping are then detuned from the atomic transitions by about 1 GHz to generate the two oﬀ-resonant Raman beams. For this we have developed a compact and agile laser system that allows us to rapidly change the operating frequencies of these lasers, as described in [32].

Indeed, at the output of the interferometer, the transition probability P from one hyper- ﬁne state to the other is given by the well-known relation for a two wave interferometer: P = 1 2 (1 + C cos∆Φ), where C is the interferometer contrast, and ∆Φ the diﬀerence of the atomic phases accumulated along the two paths.

The reference frequency will be delivered by a frequency chain, which transposes in the microwave domain the low phase noise of an RF oscillator, typically a quartz oscillator. When this transposition is performed without degradation, the phase noise power spectral density of the RF oscillator, of frequency νrf, is multiplied by (νmw/νrf)2. No single quartz oscillator fulﬁlls the requirements of ultra low phase noise over a suﬃciently large frequency range.

            "5. Propagation in the ﬁber. – In most of the experiment, the Raman lasers are generated by two independent laser sources. The two beams are mixed using a polarizing beam splitter cube, so that they have orthogonal polarizations. A small fraction of the total power can be sent to one of the two exit ports of the cube, where a fast photodetector detects the beat frequency, in order to phase lock the lasers. Both beams are ﬁnally guided towards the atoms with a polarization maintaining ﬁber. Since the Raman beams have orthogonal polarization, ﬁber length ﬂuctuations induce phase ﬂuctuations, due to the birefringence of the medium. The phase noise induced by the propagation in the ﬁber can be measured by comparing the beat signal measured after the ﬁber with the one we use for the phase lock. Figure 2 displays the power spectral density of the phase noise induced by the prop- agation, which is dominated by low frequency noise due to acoustic noise and thermal ﬂuctuations. This source of noise can be reduced by shielding the ﬁber from the air ﬂow of the air conditioning, surrounding it with some packaging foam. An alternative technique consists in using identical linear polarizations for the Raman beams. This can be achieved using a polarizer after the mixing, by generating the Raman lasers by phase modulatuion of a single laser, or by injecting with two independent lasers a power ampliﬁer. In this case, the noise is eﬃciently suppressed, as shown in ﬁgure 2, down to a level where it is negligible.\n",

Similar to the 1-photon light shift, the Eigen-energies of the atomic states are modiﬁed in higher order terms by 2-photon transitions of the Raman beams themselves (LS2). This 2-photon light shift introduces a phase shift similar to this of the usual 1-photon 2/δDoppler, light shift, but where the shift of the resonance transition is δνAC v is the Doppler-detuning of the stimulated Raman transition from and δDoppler = keff · resonance.\n",

The collected phase shifts along the classical tra- jectories of the atoms can then be calculated. Measurements of the phase shift of the interferometer versus initial position and velocity, and versus temperatures can be useful to study this systematic eﬀect, and correct for it.\n",

Wavefront aberrations appear as a very important systematic eﬀect, which depends on a non trivial way with the experimental parameters (size and temperature of the atomic cloud and interaction time).

            "Thanks to a careful study and optimization of all sources of noise and systematics on our gravimeter, we can evaluate the sensitivity and the accuracy for a space accelerometer based on classical cold atom sources and stimulated Raman transition to manipulate the atomic wavepackets. As proposed in [30], such a accelerometer might be developed easily taking advantage of the similarities with the atomic clock prototype PHARAO for which key components have already been realized and tested on ground for the Engineer Model [35]. Short term sensitivity should not be better than state of the art classic proof mass accelerometers [44], but an atom interferometer should reach a much better long term stability and accuracy, without the need of spinning the satellite. Moreover, the main sources of noise and systematics cancel in a diﬀerential measurement, as in the cases of gradiometers [45] or gyroscopes.\n",

This is why several projects are currently developed to improve the knowledge and technology for zero-g environment: the QUANTUS project [46] carry on in Germany, which study the realization of BEC in the free falling Bremen tower, the Frech project ICE [38], which tests the realization of an atom interferometer in the zero-g airplane of CNES, or the ESA project ”Atom Interferometry Sensors for Space Applications”. All these developments will soon give the possibilitiy of using such a device in fundamental physics experiments or in other applications in the ﬁeld of Earth observation, navigation or exploration of the solar system.\n",
