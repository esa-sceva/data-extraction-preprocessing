### This folder contains scripts for basic cleaning of data including LSH and PII removal.

1. Run `main.py` file to remove basic artifacts and regular old data cleaning.
2. Run `lsh.py` to find groups of duplicates, remove one from the pair to remove duplicates.
3. `test_gliner.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook to detect PII entities. A test script for now.
